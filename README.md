[Kasper Template](https://sami-m99.github.io/Kasper_Template_HTML_CSS/)

Kasper Template by native HTML and CSS.

- I used Normalize.css to make browsers render all elements more consistently and in line with modern standards, and Font Awesome for icons.
- The web page is responsive for all PCs, tablets, and phones.
